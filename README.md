## 🧠 Working Principle
1. The **MPU6050** sensor detects the orientation and movement of the hand.  
2. The **ESP32** processes the sensor data using motion algorithms.  
3. The ESP32 transmits cursor control signals via **Bluetooth HID (Human Interface Device)**.  
4. The connected computer interprets these signals as normal mouse movements.
